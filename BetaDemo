Post-alpha / Pre-beta (April 16th):
 
To get prepared for the beta assigment, we should
focus on finishing and polishing what we had for the 
alpha demo based on the feedback given to us in class.
I believe this will ideally keep us on pace to have a
final product. At this point, fixing and improving
current things is priority over adding new features.

Peter:
- Intro cutscene and/or dialogue
- Attack animation
- Enemy animation
- Finish 3rd room
- Launcher + pause menu + defeat art/design

Megan:
- Pause button (bindable in game launcher, and hard-coded for esc key) [updated]
- Volume slider [done]
- Launcher buttons change color while waiting for keypress [updated]
- Launcher read in current settings if file exists



Beta Test (April 23rd):

This Will be updated. The priority will be testing
and working with feedback, with final features added
if time permits.

Peter:
- 4th room with 'boss', win cutscene
- Enemy AI
- Visual feedback when near actable objects
- Multiple enemies

Megan:
- Pause menu and Game Launcher final design
- Music transitions (peaceful -> sleeping -> scary + win/defeat) [updated]
- Sound effects
