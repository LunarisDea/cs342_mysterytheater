Post-alpha / Pre-beta (April 16th):
 
To get prepared for the beta assigment, we should
focus on finishing and polishing what we had for the 
alpha demo based on the feedback given to us in class.
I believe this will ideally keep us on pace to have a
final product. At this point, fixing and improving
current things is priority over adding new features.

Peter:
- Intro cutscene and/or dialogue
- Attack animation
- Enemy animation
- Finish 3rd room
- Launcher + pause menu + defeat art/design

Briana:
- Sound effects
- 2 enemy types and multiple instances
- basic enemy AI
- Visual feedback when near actable objects (ie, when collided with pink hitboxes)

Megan:
- Pause button (bindable in game launcher, and hard-coded for esc key)
- Volume slider [done]
- Launcher buttons change color while waiting for keypress
- Launcher read in current settings if file exists



Beta Test (April 23rd):

This Will be updated. The priority will be testing
and working with feedback, with final features added
if time permits.

Peter:
- 4th room with 'boss', win cutscene

Briana:
- Complete sound effects (walk, locked door, attack, enemy defeat, player damage...)

Megan:
- Pause menu and Game Launcher final design
- Music transitions (peaceful -> sleeping -> scary + win/defeat)



Beta Due (April 25th)
